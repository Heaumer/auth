# Small steps
By a semblance of order of importance:

* Clean things (variable name, eventually use packages)
* Avoid the double-captcha at login.
* Avoid captcha in the general case. Two-steps login is already painful.
* /api/update is not implemented.
* /unregister is not implemented.
* Use SSL to communicate with PostgreSQL (not important assuming isolated communication)
* Maybe use different storage than PostgreSQL (keep reading why it may not be that good)

# Heavy load
## On Website and API
To be seen in production, but one-time token should generate
quite some traffic.

Multiple auth servers could be launched, communicating to
the same database, and sharing the same token cache.
The cache may be implemented using [memcached](http://memcached.org/)
or [groupcache](https://github.com/golang/groupcache)

Balancing the load on the multiple auth servers can easily
be done with [Nginx](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/load_balancing.html).

## On Database
PostgreSQL already comes with some interesting
[features](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/high-availability.html)
which would help managing the load on the Database if any.

## On SMTP
For now, we use a single, external SMTP server (for developping).
One should setup his own SMTP server in production.

However, if needed, multiple SMTP server may be used, emails
being dispatched following who they are sending to (eg. use
gmail's SMTP to communicate with @gmail.com addresses).

# Enforce chaining
It might be good to enforce token chaining by services within
the "protocol".
This could easily be done by removing info, and having login
returns those data.
